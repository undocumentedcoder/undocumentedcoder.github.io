Welcome! This website is a survival guide for undocumented students in the U.S. majoring in computer science. My goal is to give you tips on how you can succeed in college and graduate school as an undocumented immigrant with or without Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

As for me, I am a CS PhD student at one of {MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU} (undisclosed for sake of anonymity). If you'd like to know a bit more about me, check out the [About]({{site.baseurl}}/about) page. Otherwise, feel free to browse the website!
