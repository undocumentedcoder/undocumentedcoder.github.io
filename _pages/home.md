Hello! I am a computer science Ph.D. student at one of {MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU} (not disclosing which one, to stay anonymous).

I created this website to help undocumented CS majors navigate their complex circumstances and succeed in college and graduate school in the U.S.

If you'd like to hear more about my story, check out the [About]({{site.baseurl}}/about) page. Otherwise, feel free to continue browsing the website!
