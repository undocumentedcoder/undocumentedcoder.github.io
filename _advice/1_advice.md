## Why do we need good grades?

Getting good grades can be helpful if you are:
* applying to your first internship
* applying to research positions
* applying to graduate school
* applying to scholarships

(This list is not exhaustive.)

Of course, other aspects of your resume (such as work experience, relevant projects, publications, etc.) matter as well in your applications to industry jobs and graduate school. However, a high GPA can actually open the door to these opportunities that help bolster your overall application. In addition, some recruiters and application reviewers, especially in graduate school, don't even review applications from candidates who don't meet some minimum GPA requirement. It may be unfortunate, but that's the reality in certain cases. Therefore, it's better to be safe than sorry and invest in your coursework.

## How to study effectively and maintain good grades

I attended an undergraduate university where every CS course was graded on a curve. "A" grades were not just handed out; they were hard to get because everybody was smart and studied hard. Still, I was fortunately able to develop habits that helped me do fairly well and eventually graduate at the top of my class, even though I wasn't any smarter than the average student at my school.

Here are some tips:
* Minimize the time you spend in your dorm room, unless that is where you are most productive. Try to study in environments where other people are also working. This will keep you accountable and help you stay focused. (For me, I often get distracted and end up watching YouTube videos if I stay in my dorm.)
* Attend every lecture and sit near the front of the class. This will help you stay focused on the lecture. You might also befriend other motivated students who you can study with or collaborate with to complete assignments.
* During the lecture, take detailed hand-written notes. If the class moves by so fast that it's hard to take notes by hand, you can type out your notes on a laptop since it's faster.
* TAKE PRACTICE EXAMS in similar courses from top universities that are available online (search diligently for similar courses on Google). Skip questions that require knowledge of content that you didn't cover (unless you have extra time to learn new content, which can sometimes help you build intuition for solving problems that come up in your course).
* Pretend that your final exams and deadlines are 1 day earlier than they actually are (or 1 week, if you're ambitious). This way you'll have time for any last-minute work or studying that you need to do, and you'll allow time for your brain to digest all the information you've reviewed.
* Space out your studying so that your brain digests and remembers the material better. You should start studying for final exams 1-2 weeks in advance if possible.
* For courses with important group projects, think about who you want to work with early on, and meet/befriend those students so that you can actually work together on projects. The team composition can make or break your projects (and thus your final grade).
* Go to the professor's and TAs' office hours for help on homework and projects, and for tips on studying for the exam. They might give you tips that help you save a lot of time on assignments. They might also reveal something that might be useful to know when studying for the exam.
* Help other students understand the course material. You might think, "Why should I help others if we're graded on a curve, and them doing better means I get a worse final grade?" Here are some points in response to this: (1) You might learn something new yourself, or discover that you actually need to review something deeper, or strengthen your intuition, by teaching others. (2) Student whom you help will be more inclined to help you when you need it. (3) Other students, and sometimes the TAs and professors, might notice that you help others and be nicer to you (outside of class, in office hours, post-graduate when you leverage your connections to find jobs, etc.). Overall, it's good to be selfless, even if you only care about yourself. Even if your environment is intense, try not to think of your colleagues as competitors.
* Simply spend more hours studying, especially if you are a slow learner. More time means more material reviewed and more practice exams completed, which can help you build more intuition. Again, start early and space it out so that it doesn't feel overwhelming. Studying for more hours doesn't mean you're studying day and night, if you manage your time wisely.
