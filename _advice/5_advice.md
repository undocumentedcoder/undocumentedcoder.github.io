If you want to go to graduate school, having research experience is crucial, unless you are applying for non-research-oriented master's programs. This is because the strongest indicator for your research potential is whether you have had successful research experiences already, e.g., by completing projects that have led to publications at top venues or journals.

However, if you have never done research before, it can be confusing trying to figure out how to start. Keep reading below for my tips on getting started in research!

## Finding potential research opportunities

Assuming that you are in the computer science department at your university, you can quickly find information about various research labs by scrolling through the faculty page of your department website and checking out professors' websites and their lab websites. You should look for labs that are actively recruiting students; these typically have a note on their website asking you to apply to join the lab via filling out a form or sending an email. That being said, some professors do take on students even if they don't explicitly welcome them on their website. But it is a bit easier to find opportunities in labs that are actively seeking new students.

You can email the professor of a lab to see if they are taking on any students as well. However, professors are very busy people and often can't reply to all emails, so if you don't receive a response within a few days, you can try emailing a PhD student in the lab. If you reach out to several PhD students and there is still no response, chances are there aren't any open positions. You should look around at other labs at this point.

I've also heard of some students doing research at other universities by initiating a conversation over email with a professor or PhD student at an external lab. This is much harder to do, unless you have an stellar background that really grabs researchers' attention or you have a perfect fit in terms of research interests with the person you're reaching out to. If you go this route, you may have to send hundreds of emails just to find one potential opportunity.

Let's say you've identified a lab that you want to join, but now you are wondering how to get the professors' or PhD students' attention? Read on to find what research mentors look for in students.
